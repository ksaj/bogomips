bogomips measures the speed of your CPU in the highly technical unit "millions of increments in a tight loop per second".

ksaj edit: Makefile was edited to compile on Raspberry Pi. 

The rpi3 has 4 cores, and you get full results using 4 to 7 threads. Less than 4 doesnt use all the cpu so of course the results will be lower. Speed begins to degrade at 8 threads.

TODO: My plan is to update the code to run on an rpi MPICH cluster. Will be testing it on my RPI3 + ClusterHAT + 4 x RPI0's.
