# Original Description

bogomips measures the speed of your CPU in the highly technical unit 
"millions of increments in a tight loop per second".

# New

This version now compiles on Raspberry Pi sbc computers.

## Additional Notes for RPI

The rpi3 has 4 cores, and you get full results using 4 to 7 threads. 
Less than 4 doesnt use all the cpu so of course the results will be 
lower. Results degrade at 8 threads since at that point you are running
redundant tests. 

The next update will add MPI (currently mpich 2, but will probably
add mpich3 as well) for use with the Raspberry Pi ClusterHAT configured
with one Raspberry Pi 3 (B or B+) and 4 Raspberry Pi Zeros. At that 
point, the above note will no longer apply for that sort of setup.
